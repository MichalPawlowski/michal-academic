Besides working in academia, I am a Doctoral Researcher at IDEAS NCBR in the Intelligent Algorithms and Data Structures group.\nBefore that, I graduated with honors with a master’s diploma in Computer Science from the University of Warsaw. I wrote my thesis under the supervision of Dr. Marek Adamczyk (University of Wrocław). Two years prior, I obtained a double bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and Mathematics (with honors) from the same university. My supervisors were Prof. Adam Osękowski and Dr. Janusz Jabłonowski.\nMy research interests lie in the area of approximation algorithms for optimization under uncertainty. The main problems I have worked on so far revolved around prophet inequalities and online problems with delays. However, during my stay at Sapienza, I also became interested in algorithmic game theory and mechanism design.

Hikima et al. (AAAI 2021) introduced a model for this problem and achieved a $1/3$-approximation for maximizing platform profit. This was later improved to a $(1 - 1/e)$-approximation by Brubach et al. (NeurIPS 2022). In this paper, we extend the problem to a more general and realistic setting.  Firstly, we consider an online stochastic model where customer requests arrive sequentially in a random order. This better reflects real-world scenarios than the offline assumption of known requests. Secondly, we frame the problem within the context of mechanism design, allowing us to benchmark our algorithm against the optimal Bayesian mechanism rather than the more restrictive posted-price mechanisms used in prior work.  Our main contributions include developing a $(1 - 1/e)$-approximation algorithm under these generalized settings, which we regard as stronger due to the comparison with a more powerful benchmark. The key technical innovation is a novel rounding procedure for fractional matchings. This allows us to devise a new Contention Resolution Scheme (CRS) for transversal matroids, leading to improved approximation guarantees for posted-price mechanisms in combinatorial environments. Specifically, we enhance the ratio from the previous $1/(k+1)$ to $(1 - e^{-k})/k$ for the intersection of $k$ transversal matroids.","tags":[],"title":"An Improved Mechanism for Pricing Ride-Hailing Fares","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mathieu Mari","Michał Pawłowski","Runtian Ren","Piotr Sankowski"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

Given an edge-weighted rooted tree $T$ as input, a sequence of requests arriving at its vertices needs to be served in an online manner. A request $r$ is characterized by two parameters: its arrival time $t(r)  0$ and location $l(r)$ being a vertex in tree $T$. Once $r$ arrives, we can either serve it immediately or postpone this action until any time $t  t(r)$. A request that has not been served at its arrival time is called pending up to the moment it gets served. We can serve several pending requests at the same time, paying a service cost equal to the weight of the subtree containing the locations of all the requests served and the root of $T$. Postponing the service of a request $r$ to time $t  t(r)$ generates an additional delay cost of $t - t(r)$. The goal is to serve all requests in an online manner such that the total cost (i.e., the total sum of service and delay costs) is minimized. The MLA problem is a generalization of several well-studied problems, including the TCP Acknowledgment (trees of depth 1), Joint Replenishment (depth 2), and Multi-Level Message Aggregation (arbitrary depth). The current best algorithm achieves a competitive ratio of $O(d^2)$, where $d$ denotes the depth of the tree.  Here, we consider a stochastic version of MLA where the requests follow a Poisson arrival process. We present a deterministic online algorithm that achieves a constant ratio of expectations, meaning that the ratio between the expected costs of the solution generated by our algorithm and the optimal offline solution is bounded by a constant. Our algorithm is obtained by carefully combining two strategies. In the first one, we plan periodic oblivious visits to the subset of frequent vertices, whereas in the second one, we greedily serve the pending requests in the remaining vertices. This problem is complex enough to demonstrate a very rare phenomenon that \"single-minded\" or \"sample-average\" strategies are not enough in stochastic optimization.","tags":[],"title":"Online Multi-level Aggregation with Delays and Stochastic Arrivals","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tomer Ezra","Stefano Leonardi","Michał Pawłowski","Matteo Russo","Seeun William Umboh"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

Over the last decade, several works have studied generalizations of JRP with different cost functions for servicing requests. Most prior works on JRP and its generalizations have focused on the clairvoyant setting. Recently, Touitou developed a non-clairvoyant framework that provided an $O(\\sqrt{n \\log n})$ upper bound for a wide class of generalized JRP, where $n$ is the number of request types.  We advance the study of non-clairvoyant algorithms by providing a simpler, modular framework that matches the competitive ratio established by Touitou for the same class of generalized JRP. Our key insight is to leverage universal algorithms for Set Cover to approximate arbitrary monotone subadditive functions using a simple class of functions termed disjoint. This allows us to reduce the problem to several independent instances of the TCP Acknowledgement problem, for which a simple 2-competitive non-clairvoyant algorithm is known. The modularity of our framework is a major advantage as it allows us to tailor the reduction to specific problems and obtain better competitive ratios. In particular, we obtain tight $O(\\sqrt{n})$-competitive algorithms for two significant problems: Multi-Level Aggregation and Weighted Symmetric Subadditive Joint Replenishment. We also show that, in contrast, Touitou's algorithm is $\\Omega(\\sqrt{n \\log n})$-competitive for both of these problems.","tags":[],"title":"Universal Optimization for Non-Clairvoyant Subadditive Joint Replenishment","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mathieu Mari","Michał Pawłowski","Runtian Ren","Piotr Sankowski"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

This, for example, models job markets, gaming platforms, kidney exchange programs, etc. The role of the platform is to decide how to match agents together while optimizing two conflicting objectives: the quality of the matching produced, and the total waiting time of the agents. This can be modeled as an online problem called Min-cost Perfect Matching with Delays (MPMD), which has recently drawn a lot of attention. It is known that in the case when agents' arrive in an adversarial order, no online algorithm can achieve a constant-competitive ratio.  In this paper, we study the more realistic case where agents arrival times follow some stochastic assumptions, and we present two matching mechanisms, which give constant-competitive solutions. The first one is a simple greedy algorithm in which agents act in a distributed manner requiring only local communication. The second one builds global analysis tools in order to obtain even better performance guarantees. This result is rather surprising as the greedy approach cannot achieve a competitive ratio better than $O(m^{\\log 1.5 + \\varepsilon})$ in the adversarial model, where $m$ denotes the number of agents. Finally, we extend our results to the case where the delay cost corresponds to an arbitrary positive and non-decreasing function of the waiting time, as well as the case where the platform is allowed to pay a penalty cost to clear some agents' requests.","tags":[],"title":"Online Matching with Delays and Stochastic Arrival Times","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Michał Pawłowski","吳恩達"],"categories":["Demo","教程"],"content":"import libr print(\u0026#39;hello\u0026#39;) Overview  The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.
