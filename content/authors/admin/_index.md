I am pursuing a PhD degree in Computer Science. This part of my academic journey began two years ago when I got accepted to the Doctoral School of the University of Warsaw. A year later, I joined Sapienza University of Rome as a PhD student in the Department of Computer, Control, and Management Engineering. Since then, I have been in a joint PhD program between both universities. My supervisors are Prof. Piotr Sankowski and Prof. Stefano Leonardi. Besides working in academia, I am a Doctoral Researcher at IDEAS NCBR in the Intelligent Algorithms and Data Structures group.

Before that, I graduated with honors with a master's diploma in Computer Science from the University of Warsaw. I wrote my thesis under the supervision of Marek Adamczyk (University of Wrocław). Two years prior, I obtained a double bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Mathematics (also with honors) from the same university. My advisors were Prof. Adam Sękowski and Prof. Janusz Jabłonowski.

My research interests lie in the area of approximation algorithms for optimization under uncertainty. The main problems I have worked on so far revolved around prophet inequalities and online problems with delays. However, during my stay at Sapienza, I also became interested in algorithmic game theory and mechanism design. I love broadening my knowledge and experience.
